# Deployment Instructions for Streamlit Cloud

## Health Check Error Solution
If you're seeing this error:
```
The service has encountered an error while checking the health of the Streamlit app: 
Get "http://localhost:8501/healthz": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8501: connect: connection refused
```

This is happening because the deployment service is looking for the app on port 8501 (Streamlit's default port), but our app is configured to use port 5000.

## Solution Options:

### Option 1: Use Default Port for Deployment
For Streamlit Cloud, modify your app to use the default port (8501) when deployed. Add this to your `app.py`:

```python
# At the beginning of your app.py file
import os
import streamlit as st

# The rest of your code follows...
```

Then use the default Streamlit startup command in your deployment:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

### Option 2: Use a Procfile
Some deployment platforms support Procfiles to specify the command:
```
web: streamlit run app.py --server.port=$PORT
```

### Option 3: Environment-Aware Configuration
In your `.streamlit/config.toml`, use:
```toml
[server]
headless = true
# Do not specify port or address for cloud deployment
```

And deploy using the standard Streamlit command:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

The key is to allow the deployment platform to decide which port to use rather than hardcoding it.
